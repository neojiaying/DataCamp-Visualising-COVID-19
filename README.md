# Motivation
The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly disrupted the world economy. Thousands of jobs has been lost. Over the past month, due to the increase in confirmed cases in Singapore, to curb the community spread, the government has implemented a circuit breaker from April to June whereby schools and workplaces will be shut. 

This circuit breaker period happens to coincide with my summer break and I happen to be taking a module called Geospatial Analytics and Applications which I was taught R. I decided to hone my R skills by starting on this project I saw in DataCamp as I was searching for courses to learn.

# Technologies Used
1. R
2. Jupyter Notebook

# Credits

# Note
The data used is pulled on March 17, 2020.
